# This main.i file runs the subapp model.i, using an OptimizeFullSolveMultiApp
# The purpose of main.i is to find the two diffusivity_values (one in the bottom material of model.i, and one in the top material of model.i) such that the misfit between experimental observations (defined in model.i) and MOOSE predictions is minimised.
# PETSc-TAO optimisation is used to perform this inversion
#
# PETSc-TAO is set to uses "lmvm" and finite-difference approximations to the derivative of the objective function
# This means that for each PETSc-TAO iteration, 5 runs of model.i are performed: one for the current value of diffusivity_values, and four more for forward and backward finite differences around this point.  (Hence, if there were n diffusivity values, PETSc-TAO would run model.i 1 + 2*n times per iteration).
#
# This file passes the diffusivity_values to model.i via the MultiAppReporterTransfer defined below
# This file retrieves from model.i: the misfit of the temperature predicted by model.i and the experimental observations; the temperature at the observation points; the diffusivity_values (so they can be recorded in the output).  This occurs through the MultiAppReporterTransfer defined below
