 * so some capabilites might not be registered at all. Whenever a test agains an unregistered
 * capability is made the result is returned as POSSIBLE_FAIL/POSSIBLE_PASS (in case of predicate
 * negation).
 * The test harness will run the test unless the result of the check is CERTAIN_FAIL. The runtime
 * check in the executable will terminate if the result is either CERTAIN_FAIL or POSSIBLE_FAIL.
